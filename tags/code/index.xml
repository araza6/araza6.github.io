      <description>Hello,
This is my first-ever blog post (as far as I remember really). I planned to start blogging in my freshman year, and it&amp;rsquo;s been almost three years since then. Planning fallacy, as Kahneman would say. Anyway, I should thank Google Summer of Code to finally make me do it (although technically so. Fret not, I will try to make these blogs as accessible as possible) as part of my upcoming summer project with NUMFOCUS&amp;rsquo;s QuTiP.</description>
