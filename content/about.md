I have a keen interest in physics, mathematics and computer science. I am working as a student research assistant in Quantum Machine Learning in Quantum Theory Group at City University of Hong Kong. Most recently, I have worked in the area of quantum control by leveraging deep reinforcement learning. The details of our paper can be found here: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-019-0201-8
