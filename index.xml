      <description>Hello,
This is my first-ever blog post (as far as I remember really). I planned to start blogging in my freshman year, and it&amp;rsquo;s been almost three years since then. Planning fallacy, as Kahneman would say. Anyway, I should thank Google Summer of Code to finally make me do it (although technically so. Fret not, I will try to make these blogs as accessible as possible) as part of my upcoming summer project with NUMFOCUS&amp;rsquo;s QuTiP.</description>

      <description>I am a Computing Mathematics major, and physics and computer science minor here at the City University of Hong Kong. I like to research the union of physics, mathematics and computer science. Most recently, I have worked in the area of quantum control by leveraging deep reinforcement learning. The details of our paper can be found here: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-019-0201-8</description>
