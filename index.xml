      <title>Introduction to Autodifferentiation in Machine Learning</title>

      <description>Disclaimer: This blog essentialy summarizes this amazing review paper: Automatic Differentiation in Machine Learning: a Survey. All the tables and (fancy) images in the blog are taken from the paper. Invested readers should check out the full paper (linked).
Autodiff (short for Autodifferentiation) is extensively used in modern machine learning tasks. Libraries like Tensorflow, Pytorch, JAX and several others have made it easier to calculate the derivatives of arbitrary functions. In this blog, I will be going through the theory behind autodiff, explain what autodiff is NOT, and finally chain it up to machine learning (with a small code-snippet too).</description>

      <description>Hello,
This is my first-ever blog post (as far as I remember really). I planned to start blogging in my freshman year, and it&amp;rsquo;s been almost three years since then. Planning fallacy, as Kahneman would say. Anyway, I should thank Google Summer of Code to finally make me do it (although technically so. Fret not, I will try to make these blogs as accessible as possible) as part of my upcoming summer project with NUMFOCUS&amp;rsquo;s QuTiP.</description>

      <description>I am a Computing Mathematics major, and physics and computer science minor here at the City University of Hong Kong. I like to research the union of physics, mathematics and computer science. Most recently, I have worked in the area of quantum control by leveraging deep reinforcement learning. The details of our paper can be found here: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-019-0201-8</description>
